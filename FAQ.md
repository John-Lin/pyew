Q: Can I use Pyew in my non GPL project?

A: It depends on the project itself. Depending on the type of project you can get a LGPL license exclusive for your project in any of the following situations:

  * If your project is commercial: You need to purchase a commercial license. Contact me for more details.
  * If your project is open source: You can get a LGPL license exclusive for your project if it's open source and the license used is compatible with the GPL. In order to get a LGPL license exclusive for your FOSS, please do contact me.
